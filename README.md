=====================
This is the source code for my NetTuts articles: [Maintainable Automated UI Tests](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/maintainable-automated-ui-tests/) and [Tips to Avoid Brittle UI Tests](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/tips-to-avoid-brittle-ui-tests/). A copy of this code is available from [nettuts github](https://github.com/tutsplus/maintainable-automated-ui-tests) account. If you want to submit an issue or ask a question either post a comment on articles on nettuts or send an issue on the nettuts copy of the code.
